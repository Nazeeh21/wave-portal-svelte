# Integrate your Svelte app with smart contract

## Overview

This article focuses on developing a Full-stack dApp using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/), [Solidity](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.10/), and [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/).

### What we will be building?

- A front end that allows the user to send a greeting message along with a wave to the contract owner ([demo](https://wave-portal-svelte.vercel.app/))
- Display all the greeting messages on the front-end along with the sender's address
- A contract for storing a user's greeting message and their wave

> Have a look at the [demo video](https://youtu.be/d2BlC9AGOXc) to get the better understanding of what we'll be building.
> 
> Refer to the code located [here](https://github.com/Nazeeh21/wave-portal-svelte/tree/main/code/wave-portal-complete) to follow along.


### The Tech Stack

- Client-side framework: [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/)
- Ethereum development environment: [Hardhat](https://hardhat.org/)
- Ethereum Web Client library: [Ethers.js](https://docs.ethers.io/v5/)

### Prerequisites

1. Node.js environment on your local machine
2. [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) extension in your browser

You do not need real Ether as we will be using a test network for this tutorial.

### Getting Started

Clone [this](https://github.com/Nazeeh21/wave-portal-svelte/tree/main/code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate) svelte starter template which contains all the required components and CSS properties by running the following command.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/Nazeeh21/wave-portal-svelte/tree/main/code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate
```

Following that, navigate into the project directory and install `node_modules` by running the below command.

```shell
cd wave-portal-svelte/code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/
yarn
```

Inside the `wave-portal-starter-boilerplate` directory, install `ethers` and `hardhat` by running the following command.

```shell
yarn add ethers hardhat @nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle ethereum-waffle chai @nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers
```

### Initializing and Configuring Ethereum development environment

To compile and deploy our smart contract, let's initialize a new Ethereum development environment with **Hardhat** by running the command below. Before running the script, make sure we are in the `wave-portal-starter-boilerplate` folder.

```shell
npx hardhat
```

Select the following settings when prompted 

- **What do you want to do?** .Select _Create a basic sample project_
- **Hardhat Project Root** . _Press Enter to set current directory as root_
- **Do you want to add a .gitignore? (Y/n)** . n


<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634292845974/at3uW4CHR.png" alt="image.png" />
</p>

Following that, run the following command

```shell
yarn add --dev "hardhat@^2.6.6" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-waffle@^2.0.0" "ethereum-waffle@^3.0.0" "chai@^4.2.0" "@nomiclabs/hardhat-ethers@^2.0.0" "ethers@^5.0.0"
```

Now you should see a `hardhat.config.js` file. You should also have the `contracts` and `scripts` folders in your `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/` directory.

Due to a [MetaMask configuration issue](https://hardhat.org/metamask-issue.html), we need to update the chain Id of our Hardhat Configuration to **1337**. Also, we need to update the location for the [artifacts](https://hardhat.org/guides/compile-contracts.html#artifacts) to be in the `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/src` directory of our app.

Navigate to `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/hardhat.config.js` file. This file consists of all the configurations regarding the hardhat ethereum environment. Make sure your `hardhat.config.js` looks like this.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  solidity: "0.8.4",
  paths: {
    artifacts: "./src/artifacts",
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {
      chainId: 1337,
    },
  },
};
```

We have our **Ethereum Environment** ready, so let's get our smart contract.

Delete `Greeter.sol` under the `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/contracts` folder in the root directory and create a new file named `WavePortal.sol`. `WavePortal.sol` is our smart contract for this project. In this new file, paste the smart contract from below. This contract will allow us to store the _wave_, _reaction type_, _greeting message_ and grants prizes to a random user.

Your `WavePortal.sol` file should look like this.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: UNLICENSE
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract WavePortal {
	enum Reaction {
		Wave,
		Cake,
		Hype
	}

	struct Wave {
		Reaction reaction;
		string message;
		address waver;
		uint256 timestamp;
	}

	uint256 totalWaves;
	Wave[] public waveList;

	event NewWave(
		Reaction reaction,
		string message,
		address indexed from,
		uint256 timestamp
	);

	constructor() {}

	function wave(Reaction _reaction, string memory _message) public {
		totalWaves += 1;
		waveList.push(Wave(_reaction, _message, msg.sender, block.timestamp));
		emit NewWave(_reaction, _message, msg.sender, block.timestamp);
	}

	function getAllWaves() public view returns (Wave[] memory) {
		return waveList;
	}

	function getTotalWaves() public view returns (uint256) {
		return waveList.length;
	}
}
```

#### Explanation of the code above:

Line 1: Specifying [SPDX license](https://spdx.org/licenses/) type, which is an addition after Solidity ^0.6.8. Whenever the source code of a smart contract is made available to the public, these licenses can help resolve/avoid copyright issues. If you do not wish to specify any license type, you can use a special value UNLICENSED or simply skip the whole comment (it won't result in an error, just a warning).

Line 2: Declaring the solidity version.

Line 4: Starting our Contract named WavePortal.

Line 5: Declaring `Reaction` as *enum* with Wave, Cake and Hype as predefined values.

Line 11: Declaring `Wave` as struct containing variables `reaction` of type *Reaction*, `message` of type *string*, `waver` of type *address* and `timestamp` of type *uint*.

Line 18: Declaring variable `totalWaves` of type *uint* to store the total number of waves.

Line 19: Declaring an array `wavelist` of type of *Wave* to store all the waves.

Line 21: Declaring an event `NewWave`, containing information about the reaction, message, sender address and timestamp of the wave. This event gets emitted once our wave gets store in the contract successfully.

Line 28: Initializing this constructor, but do not need to set anything so leaving that empty.

Line 30: Declaring function **wave** with two arguments, `_reaction` of type Reaction which will store our reaction information and `_message` of type string which will store the message of the user. Declaring `_message` as **memory** means, it will get destroyed from the memory once the function gets executed.

Line 36: Declaring function **getAllWaves**, that returns all the an array containing all the waves.

Line 40: Declaring function **getTotalWaves**, that returns the number of waves.

### Interacting with the Ethereum blockchain

We can interact with our smart contract from our Svelte app using the combination of our contract's [ABI](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.5.3/abi-spec.html), the `Ethers.js` library, and our _contract address_.

ABI stands for Application Binary Interface. We can think of ABI as an interface that provides our frontend with all the available callable functions and variables from our smart contract.

We can get ABIs by compiling our smart contract using a development framework like Hardhat. You can often find the ABI for a smart contract on [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/).

So, let us compile our smart contract by running the command below.

```shell
npx hardhat compile
```

On successful compiling, you should see a new folder named **artifacts** under the `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/src` folder. You can see the ABI of our contract under _artifacts/contracts/WavePortal.json_ folder. We can use this ABI by simply importing this `.json` file.

### Deploying to localhost

For easy and fast interaction, we will be deploying our contract to a local test node. For that, we need to start a local chain by running the following command

```shell
npx hardhat node
```

Running this command will list all the accounts and their private keys in your terminal.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634374126123/MLK6SlBIU.png" alt="test-accounts.png" />
</p>

These are the 20 test accounts created for us by Hardhat that we can use to deploy and test our smart contract locally. Each account has a sufficient amount of test Ether.

Let us deploy our smart contract to localhost using one of these accounts. But before that, navigate to the `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/scripts` folder and rename `scripts/sample-script.js` to `scripts/deploy.js`. This file will get executed when we'll try to deploy our contract. Inside this `deploy.js` file, update your `main()` function such that your `deploy.js` file looks like below.

```javascript
// deploy.js

async function main() {
  const WavePortal = await hre.ethers.getContractFactory("WavePortal");
  const wavePortal = await WavePortal.deploy();
  await wavePortal.deployed();
  console.log("WavePortal deployed to:", wavePortal.address);
}

main()
  .then(() => process.exit(0))
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error(error);
    process.exit(1);
  });
```

### Explanation of the code above

Line 1: Declaring an asynchronous function `main`, that executes when we will deploy our smart contract.

Line 2: Calling `hre.ethers.getContactFactory` that returns an instance of the contract.

Line 3: Calling `.deploy()`, that deploys an instance of the contract

Line 4: Calling `.deployed()`, that awaits for the contract to get deployed.

Line 5: Logging the address of the deployed contract in the console.

Line 7: Calling the `main()` function and add error handling.

Now, let us run the deploy script and provide the flag ` --network localhost` to the CLI which indicates that we want to deploy to our local network.

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

This script will deploy our smart contract to our local network and now we should be able to interact with it.

On successful deployment, you should see the following output in your terminal

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634375594970/oay6gqtD6.png" alt="console-image.png" />
</p>

> This contract is deployed on the local node, using the first account that was created when we started the local network.

Store this address for your reference, as we will need it while interacting with our smart contract from our Svelte Client.

Now, to send a transaction to our smart contract deployed on the test node, we need to configure MetaMask wallet to use one of the accounts created by hardhat while running the command `npx hardhat node`

Let's import one of these accounts into our MetaMask wallet and use its test ethers. To do so, open MetaMask and update the network to be **Localhost 8545**

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634376286673/KoVETGaBw.png" alt="image.png" />
</p>
	
On **Localhost 8545**, click on **Import Account** from the **accounts** menu on the top-right.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634376404075/IEDb1ytMG.png" alt="image.png" />
</p>

Copy and paste any one of the **private keys** from the CLI and click on **Import**. Once the account is imported, you should see the MetaMask interface like this.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634376684523/ZmN9K5RmW.png" alt="image.png" />
</p>

As we have our contract deployed and our MetaMask wallet configured, let us start interacting from our Svelte frontend.

### Connecting with Svelte Client

For this tutorial, we are not going to focus on developing the UI, instead, we will be focussing entirely on the core functionality and integration. In the frontend, we will mainly focus on 2 things 

1. Fetch all the greeting messages from our smart contract and display them in the frontend.
2. Create functions to send messages along with the greeting.

Let us start integration with our front end. To test our frontend, start the server using the following command.

> Before starting the server, make sure that the current directory is `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/`

```shell
yarn dev
```

Now you should see our front end as below on the `localhost:5000`. If `localhost:5000` doesn't work then try `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634395206936/aMtLiVCU7.png" alt="image.png" />
</p>

You will notice that, by clicking on any of the greetings, nothing is happening. Also, we are not able to see any previous greetings. So, let us add logic to send greetings to our smart contract and fetch all the previous greetings.

Navigate to the `App.svelte` file under the `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/src` folder. `App.svelte` gets rendered on the home page upon server start and thus contains all the functionality to fetch the waves.

Update your contract address on line 10, which logged into the CLI while deploying it.

```javascript
const CONTRACT_ADDRESS = 'YOUR_CONTACT_ADDRESS';
```

Now, paste the below code in the `getAllWaves()` function on line 12 in `App.svelte`. This function fetches all the greetings from the blockchain network to our Client.

```javascript
async function getAllWaves() {
    if (!window.ethereum) {
      return;
    }
    
    const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
    const wavePortalContract = new ethers.Contract(
      CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
      WavePortal.abi,
      provider
    );
    const recievedWaves = await wavePortalContract.getAllWaves();
    
    if (!recievedWaves) {
      waveList = [];
      return;
    }
    
    const normalizeWave = (wave) => ({
      reaction: wave.reaction,
      message: wave.message,
      waver: wave.waver,
      timestamp: new Date(wave.timestamp * 1000),
    });
    
    waveList = recievedWaves
      .map(normalizeWave)
      .sort((a, b) => b.timestamp - a.timestamp);
    console.log('waveList: ', waveList);
    return;
  }
```

### Explanation of the code above

Line 1: Declaring an asynchronous function `getAllWaves()` that will fetch all the waves from our smart contract.

Line 2: Checking if we are getting an **ethereum** object in our window, if not we will return null.

Line 6: Getting the provider to access the blockchain data.

Line 7: Creating a local instance of our contract by passing _Contract address_, _Contract abi_ and _provider_ as an argument. 

Line 12: Fetching all the waves from our smart contract by calling `getAllWaves()` method.

Line 13: If we do not get any waves, then we will return an empty array. 

Line 18: Declaring function `normalizeWave()`, that will destruct the wave.

Line 25: Destructing the _recievedWaves()_, sorting on the basis of _timestamp_ and assigning these sorted waves to the `waveList` variable.

We have to import the ABI of our **WavePortal** contract which enables us to interact with our smart contract. Thus add the following `import` statements on line 3 in `App.svelte`.

```svelte
import { ethers } from 'ethers';
import WavePortal from './artifacts/contracts/WavePortal.sol/WavePortal.json'
```

Now, start the development server of svelte. You should see an error as shown below.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634411696569/FNNU0XSkV.png" alt="image" />
</p>

This is because we are trying to import a `json` file in our `App.svelte` and to import a `json` we need to add an extra plugin `rollup-plugin` by running the following command.

```shell
yarn add @rollup/plugin-json
```

Navigate to the `rollup.config.js` file in `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/` _directory_. This file contains all your configurations for the **rollup**. Now, in your `rollup.config.js` file navigate to the `plugins` array as show below and add `json(),` on line 60.

```javascript
plugins: [
     commonjs(),
     json(),
     ...
]
```

In `rollup.config.js` file, in `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/` _directory_ in order to use `json()`, we also need to import `json()` from our newly added plugin, thus add the following import statement in line 7 of `rollup.config.js` file.

```javascript
import json from "@rollup/plugin-json";
```

Now, restart the development server, you should see the frontend server started successfully. Currently, you won't see any greetings on our front end because we don't have one. So, let's add a function to send the greeting.

For that, navigate to `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/src/components/SendWave.svelte` file. This file will contain logic for sending the wave. Complete the `sendWaveReaction()` function in line 7 by pasting the code from below. This function will send _wave reaction_.

```javascript
async function sendWaveReaction(reaction, message) {
    loading = true;
    try {
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(window.ethereum);
      const signer = provider.getSigner();
      const wavePortalContract = new ethers.Contract(
        CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
        WavePortal.abi,
        signer
      );
      const transaction = await wavePortalContract.wave(reaction, message, {
        gasLimit: 400000,
      });
      await transaction.wait();
      message = '';
      fetchWaves();
      loading = false;
    } catch (error) {
      alert('Error while sending wave', error);
      loading = false;
    }
  }
```

### Explanation of the code above

Line 1: Declaring an asynchronous function `sendWaveReaction()`, that will send our reaction to our smart contract on the blockchain network.

Line 2: Setting `loading` variable to _true_.

Line 4: Declaring a `provider` variable that contains the read-only abstraction to access the blockchain data.

Line 5: Storing the _signer_ object from our _provider_ in `singer` variable, that will allow us to sign the transaction.

Line 6: Creating the local instance of our smart contract.

Line 11: Calling the `wave()` function from our smart contract, with _reaction_ and _message_ as an arguments.

Line 14: Waiting for the transaction to get completed.

Line 15: Resetting the value of `message` variable after sending the wave.

Line 16: Fetching all the waves again. 

Line 17: Setting the `loading` indicator to _false_.

Line 19: Showing an _alert_ if something goes wrong.

We also need to add the following import statements in `SendWave.svelte` file in line 2.

```javascript
  import { ethers } from 'ethers';
  import WavePortal from '../artifacts/contracts/WavePortal.sol/WavePortal.json';
```

To interact with our smart contract from our front end, we need to connect our MetaMask wallet to our website. For that, in `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/src/components/Wallet.svelte` file, complete the `connectWallet()` function in line 6 by pasting the below code. `Wallet.svelte` will contain all the logic required for connecting MetaMask wallet to our frontend.

```javascript
async function connectWallet() {
    walletConnected = false;
    const { ethereum } = window;
    await ethereum
      .request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })
      .then((accountList) => {
        const [firstAccount] = accountList;
        account = firstAccount;
        walletConnected = true;
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        walletConnected = false;
        connectWalletError = error;
        console.log('error connecting wallet');
      });
  }
```

### Explanation of the above code

Line 1: Declaring an asynchronous function `connectWallet()`.

Line 2: Setting `walletConnected` variable to _false_.

Line 3: Getthing an **ethereum** object from our window.

Line 4: Calling `ethereum.request({ method: 'eth_requestAccounts' })` that will give us the accounts of the connected wallet.

Line 7: Getting **first account** from an array of all the accounts

Line 8: Assining `account` variable the value of _first account_.

Line 9: Setting `walletConnected` variable to _true_.

Line 12: Setting `walletConnected` variable to _false_, if encountered an error while connecting wallet.

Now, restart the server if needed and you should see a MetaMask popup on clicking the **Connect MetaMask** button. After connecting we'll be able to successfully send greetings, waves as well as fetch all the greetings. 

Now, we have our smart contract running successfully on a local node, so let's deploy it on live TestNet.

### Deploying to Ropsten TestNet

We'll be deploying to the **Ropsten** test network in this tutorial. For that, update your MetaMask wallet to connect to the Ropsten network and send yourself some test ethers from [this test faucet](https://faucet.ropsten.be/).

We can get access to Ropsten by signing up with a service like [Infura](https://infura.io/dashboard/ethereum/cbdf7c5eee8b4e2b91e76b77ffd34533/settings) or [Alchemy](https://www.alchemyapi.io/). (For this tutorial I've used Infura)

Once you've created the app in Infura, you'll get a URL to a node that looks like this

```shell
https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/your_project_id
```

To deploy to the test network we need to update our hardhat config with a piece of additional network information. One thing is to set the private key of the wallet we'll be deploying from. You can export your private key from MetaMask by clicking menu > Account details > Export private key.

<p align="center">
<img src="https://cdn.hashnode.com/res/hashnode/image/upload/v1634414939857/znFCh5i1q.png" alt="image" />
</p>

Now add networks property in `hardhat.config.js` in line 24 under `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/` directory as shown below.

```shell
module.exports = {
  defaultNetwork: "hardhat",
  paths: {
    artifacts: './src/artifacts',
  },
  networks: {
    hardhat: {},
    ropsten: {
      url: "https://ropsten.infura.io/v3/your_project_id,
      accounts: [`0x${your-private-key}`]
    }
  },
  solidity: "0.8.4",
};
```

To deploy our smart contract to the Ropsten network, run the following command in `code/wave-portal-starter-boilerplate/` directory.

```shell
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network ropsten
```

On successful deployment, you should see the following output in your terminal.

```shell
WavePortal deployed to: 0x4f5F98f3696e1dDc107fd786d252D6Ff8D351B6b
```

Once your contract is deployed you should be able to start interacting with it. Now you should be able to view your live Contract on [Etherscan TestNet Explorer](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/).

### What next?

A lot of things can still be improved in this project.

Try
- showing the **loading** indicator while the transaction is in progress
- detect the current network of the MetaMask
- if the user is on a network other than **Ropsten**, then prompt the user to change the network.

Congratulations! You have integrated your first dApp using Svelte. Try the challenges mentioned above and feel free to connect with me if you encounter any errors.
